# LondonBikeRides
In this project, we downloaded the London Bike Sharing dataset from Kaggle, performed initial data exploration, transformed and cleaned the data, and mapped numerical codes to descriptive names. Finally, we saved the processed data to an Excel file for further visualization in Tableau. This process demonstrates the typical workflow of a data analysis project, combining data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

By following these steps, we ensure that our analysis is thorough and our findings are easily interpretable, making them suitable for presentation and further exploration in Tableau.
